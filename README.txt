This is a UNITY created Hex based board game based off of other games such as Civilization. The Unity project allows the user to create their own Map or generate their own with numerous specifications that can be made in the inspector. 
Maps can be randomly generated or the user can create their own with UI tools. Each map can be saved to their machine and loaded through the UI menu also.
The project mainly focuses on generation of Hex maps and doesn't include features of gameplay per say; the only implementation of gameplay is Units that can be moved around the map.
Quick notes:
-	Units can be spawned by pressed ‘U’ whilst in edit mode
-	Units can be de-spawned by pressing ‘Ctrl’ + ‘U’ 


This project was made by following a tutorial series that I found online.
